# Roadmap for Android Terminal Emulator

Android Terminal Emulator development is complete. I am not accepting additional feature patches for the project.

I am accepting additional language translation patches. (Those are easy to integrate without breaking things.)

See [[Wrapping up Development on Android Terminal Emulator]] for details of the wrapping-up process.
