# Roadmap for Terminal Emulator for Android

Terminal Emulator for Android development is complete. I am not accepting additional feature patches
for the project.

I **am** accepting additional language translation patches. (Those are easy to integrate without breaking things.)

See [[Wrapping up Development on Terminal Emulator for Android]] for details of the wrapping-up process.
