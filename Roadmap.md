# Roadmap for Android Terminal Emulator

My goal for Android Terminal Emulator is to have a simple, easy-to-use terminal emulator that works on a wide variety of Android devices. I think ATE has reached that goal, so for the most part I plan to just maintain it as-is in the future.

I will make changes to support:

* New CPU architectures (e.g. x86.)
* New versions of the SDK and NDK.
* New types of Android devices.
* New versions of Android.
* Unusual Android devices that have unusual behavior, if we can figure out a work-around.

As far as significant new features, those will have to come from the community. Most of the new features in ATE in the last two years have come from the community. (Thanks guys, you're the best!)

There are a lot of good features that people have suggested, check the [Issues List](https://github.com/jackpal/Android-Terminal-Emulator/issues).

## Release schedule

I will make new releases whenever the tree has accumulated enough new features, translations, or bug fixes that it would be worthwhile. Sometimes the release may have to wait a few weeks until I have enough time. It takes about 10 hours to make a release. That includes testing, triaging the inevitable bug reports, fixing bugs and re-releasing, and so on.
