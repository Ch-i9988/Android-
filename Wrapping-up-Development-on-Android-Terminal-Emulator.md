Android Terminal Emulator Development is Wrapping Up
----------------------------------------------------

I’ve decided to wrap up working on Android Terminal Emulator. The next release will be the final version of Android Terminal Emulator that includes new features. There may be additional releases after that to fix regressions, but no new features.

FAQ
-----

Q: Why?

A: I want to work on other things. Maintaining Android Terminal Emulator is taking up too much time. It takes me a couple of days a month just to keep up with the current level of email and patches.

Q: Why not just slow down?

A: I’ve tried that, but it’s not fair to developers, who would see their patches languish for months. Also it’s harder for me, because I have to relearn how to QA a release if I only do it once in a while.

Q: Why not let someone else take over the project?

A: I’d rather keep ATE the way it is, and let people fork it, or even develop their own alternatives.

Q: Will you be keeping Android Terminal Emulator in the Play Market?

A: Yes.

Q: Will you be keeping Android Terminal Emulator source code on GitHub?

A: Yes.

Q: Will you be accepting pull requests for new features?

A: No, I will no longer be accepting pull requests for new features.

Q: But I've got a pull request ready to go .. I just forgot to send it in.

A: OK, go ahead and send it in. If it's small enough, or cool enough, I might accept it. (This is a limited time offer. Probably good until around 6/15/2014.)

Q: Will you be accepting pull requests for updated translations?

A: Yes, I will be accepting pull requests for new translations.

Q: What about existing open github Issues?

A: I will be closing them as won’t fix.

Thanks

I want to thank all the developers, artists and translators who have contributed to Android Terminal Emulator over the years. It has been an honor working with all of you on this project. 

I want to especially call out two contributors:

Developer Steven Luo made major contributions to all levels of the application. He reworked the UI to add multi-window support. He made proper use of background services. He improved the Linux terminal emulation. He added multi-byte-character support. He refactored the program to allow for it to be used as a library. He also taught me what a clean set of patches looks like.

Graphic designer Nathanel Titane collaborated with me to create a beautiful and playful application icon. The current icon is so much better than the “programmer art” that it replaced.
