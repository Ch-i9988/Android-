# Android Terminal Emulator Privacy Policy

Android Terminal Emulator does not collect, store, transmit, or share any Personally Identifiable Information with anyone or anything.

## Externally Observable Actions

If you use Android Terminal Emulator to run a command line application that connects to the network (such as an IRC chat program, or a ssh shell, or an FTP client, or a BitTorrent client), then it may be possible for third parties to observe your activities by observing your network traffic. The risks are similar to using "Incognito Mode" in a web browser.

## Logging of ANR and FC Events

If you experience an "Application Not Responding", or "Forced Close" event while using Android Terminal Emulator, you may be asked for permission to upload a crash report. If you agree, some information about the crash will be uploaded. This information is designed to not contain any Personally Identifiable Information, but may include information such as the stack crawl of what the program was trying to do when it crashed, as well as limited information about your phone's software (such as which version of Android Terminal Emulator you were using.)
