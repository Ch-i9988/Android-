The Android Terminal Emulator is a VT-100 compatible terminal emulator for Android devices.

A terminal emulator is a program that makes your Android phone act like an old fashioned computer terminal. It is useful for accessing the Linux command line shell that is built into every Android phone. This lets you run various Linux command line utilities.

If you don't know what all that means, and why it's cool, then this probably isn't the program for you. (Sorry!)
